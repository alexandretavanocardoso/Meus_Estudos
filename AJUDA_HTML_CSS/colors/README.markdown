# A thousand Colors (HTML)

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/sweaver2112/pen/JjXVRbR](https://codepen.io/sweaver2112/pen/JjXVRbR).

A comprehensive, filterable, queryable HTML 'database' of 1000 colors,  via  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_colors

The Search field is full regex (hey, it's not any worse than SQL), so it's possible to use | for simple alternation (red|blue), or even more advanced patterns like "colors that start and end with same letter" :  "^(\w).*\1$"
